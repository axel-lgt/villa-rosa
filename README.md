Villa Rosa is a small project for a one page mock restaurant showcase website that I imagined. This straight forward project was made in **React** and was imagined as a way to promote a restaurant called Villa Rosa. The website is divided in three categories: Home, Services and Contact. It also uses a **SwiperJS** carousel and can be browsed with a header.

## Technologies
In order to make this project, I used the following technologies:


### Front-end
- React
- React Scroll
- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- SwiperJS
- JavaScript

## File hierarchy
The wesbite was deployed on [Netlify](https://villarosa.netlify.app).

### Front-end
In order to achieve my goal of making a one page website, I seperated each category (Home, Services and Contact) in a component with a height of 100vh. I also used a module called **React Scroll** to handle the header and the smooth scrolling to the categories.

In the Home component, I used **SwiperJS** to create a stacked carousel with images I found on **Unsplash**.

In the Services component, I made a responsive grid with the restaurant's services icons. When an icon is clicked, a tab opens with the name and description of the service. Moreover, I made a custom hook in **useOutsideClick.js** to close the tab when another one is clicked or if the user clicks outside the grid.

Thank you for checking out my work, bon appÃ©tit! :cook:
